    <p>East Shore Branch YMCA 40.26392, -76.88929</p>

    <p>
        The YMCA is old bridge brick building that was build in 1933. It is designed
        in the Italian Romanesque style and as you can see there have been additions 
        over the years.  Mason is no where to be seen.

        As you look around, someone comes out of the building and approaches you. 
        They are dress in athletic cloths, their face is flush from their work out. 
        They smile as they come to a stop and ask "Are you looking for Mason? He said
        to give you this."  They reach out with a note.  You take it and open it 
        and read:
    </p>
    
        <p>
            "Go to the 'Never again' monument. Make sure no one follows"
        </p>
