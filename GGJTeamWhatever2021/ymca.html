    <p> Holocaust Monument 40.26840, -76.89332</p>

    <p>The Holocaust Monument is a tribute to remember the structure of iron and
    stone. It is a reminder of one of the darkest chapters in history and a
    reminder to "Never Again" allow it to happen again.</p>

    <p>At the base of the monument you see a bouquet of flowers. You pick it up
    and inspect the bundle. The scent fills you nose as you pull out a small
    card. The card reads:</p>

    <p>"In Midtown, find the gentleman and the Scholar"</p>
