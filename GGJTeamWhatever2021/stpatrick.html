        St. Patrick Cathedral 40.26368, -76.88666

        Upon arriving in front of St. Patrick Cathedral you do not see anyone 
        matching Mason's description. Looking around you notice a flyer on a building
        wall. It is a religious flying that reads "Are you lost and looking to 
        find your way to salvation?"  It is filled with the excepted religious info
        about finding Jesus, but on the back of the flyer, you once again see Mason's
        handwriting it reads:
    </p>
    
        <p>
            "Young man, there's no need to feel down"
